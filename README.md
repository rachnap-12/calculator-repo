# Calculator-Repo
  This is my repo for standard calculator.
## Features and Functionalities
1. It supports basic arithmetic operations using symbols ( + , - , * , รท and %).
2. It supports clear input option.
3. It supports chained arthimetic operations (e.g 23+43*12-13).
4. It supports BODMAS rule.

## Exception Handling
1. If the operator is clicked without any number first, it throws an alert "Enter a number first".
2. If the length of the result is more it reduces the font size to accomodate the result on the display.
